          Korea Chess Academy (Korean: 한국기원) is the management organization
          of Korean professional Go. Its history can be traced back to the Seoul
          Chess Academy founded by Zhao Nanzhe in November 1945.
        </p>
        <p>
          Zhao Nanzhe went to Japan in 1937 to learn from Go player Kiya
          Mikyudan. In 1945, he returned to China and founded the Chess Academy.
          Koreans traditionally use the patrol method to open the market. After
          opening the Korean Chess Academy, Zhao persuaded the Koreans to open
          the game with a white plate. In 1956, the national hand game was
          established, and the game of Go was promoted among the people.

            <h5>
              Zhao Nanzhe (Korean: 조남철, November 30, 1923-July 2, 2006),
              Korean Go professional nine-dan, the father of modern Korean Go.
            </h5>
            <p>
              In 1946, Zhao Nanzhe founded the Hanseong Chess Institute, and
              Korean professional Go officially appeared. In 1950, under the
              organization of Zhao Nanzhe, South Korea held the modern Go
              competition for the first time. Zhao was designated as the third
              dan, and the others were designated as the first dan. In 1955,
              Zhao persuaded the President of South Korea, Syngman Rhee, to
              organize a delegation of professional chess players to go to
              Taiwan to compete in an international competition with local Go
              players and win. This victory boosted the low morale of the Korean
              people, and also made Zhao and Hyundai Go famous. Soon,
              professional chess games in South Korea were established one after
              another, and the Seoul Chess Academy was rebuilt in 1968 and
              renamed the Korean Chess Academy. Zhao himself dominated the
              Korean chess world for a long time after the 1950s, until the
              junior chess player Kim In returned from studying in Japan and
              lost his dominance. In 1983, he was awarded the 9th Dan. In 1994,
              he entered the National Chess Competition and became the oldest
              chess player to enter the professional chess competition. With his
              support, his nephew Zhao Zhixun went to Japan to study and later
              became the number one chess player in Japan.

              was from 2002 to 2012. Li Jiuduan's chess style was sharp in the
              early stage, and he was good at large-scale attacks and kills. In
              the middle game, he was called "fourteenth dan", but his layout
              was poor. Later, as he got older and his skills gradually matured,
              he began to transform into an all-around chess style, able to
              attack and defend, combining strength and softness, and became a
              generation of chess masters. Chess style is feminine and ghostly,
              often playing ghostly hands, strong combat power and extremely
              precise calculations, often dies a large piece of chess at the
              beginning, and then uses various flavors to contain the opponent,
              and even resurrects the dead chess. Chess fans call it "zombie
              flow". At the same time, he also has a high level of psychological
              quality. In the World Series, he often catches up with the
              reversal and wins the game when he is behind. During the period
              from 2005 to 2010, he had many confrontations with China's Guli
              Jiuduan, which attracted a lot of attention. In 2016, on behalf of
              human beings and Google’s AlphaGo software, they fought Wufanqi.
              Although they lost 1:4 in the end, the victorious game indicated
              that humans still have the possibility of defeating computers.
