        <h3>Chinese Chess Academy</h3>
        <p>
          On March 15, 1992, the founding ceremony of the Chinese Chess Academy
          was grandly held. The Chinese Chess Academy broke ground in October
          1988 and was finally completed after more than three years. The
          Chinese Chess Academy is a public institution directly under the
          National Sports Commission. It is a comprehensive training base and
          competition venue for Chinese chess sports. It also directly manages
          the national team training tasks of the National Go Team, Xiangqi and
          International Chess, and undertakes various major domestic and
          international chess games. At the same time, various mass chess and
          card activities will be carried out.
        </p>
