        <h3>About Haifeng</h3>
        <p>
          In 1986, based on his love for Go, Mr. Lin Wenbo decided to donate 30
          million yuan to set up a foundation with the purpose of promoting Go.
          After consulting with Lin Haifeng, a national player, he received his
          full support and promised to serve as the first chairman. The "Haifeng
          Cultural and Educational Foundation" was established and started the
          career of promoting Weiqi. Since organizing professional and amateur
          competitions requires a lot of money and manpower, the Haifeng
          Foundation has been donated by Chairman Lin Wenbo for many years, and
          has grown rapidly. However, professional competitions are still
          insufficient. Therefore, there is a need for organizational
          adjustments. Director Lin The president decided to merge the "Haifeng
          Cultural and Educational Foundation" into the "Pearson Cultural and
          Educational Foundation" in order to play the role of one plus one
          greater than two.

        <p class="lastParagraph">
          The Pearson Cultural and Educational Foundation is another consortium
          legal person donated by Chairman Lin Wenbo and other families, and has
          been engaged in special education work. Since the funds are more
          abundant than the Haifeng Cultural and Educational Foundation, after
          the "Haifeng Cultural and Educational Foundation" was merged into the
          "Pearson Cultural and Educational Foundation", the Haifeng Cultural
          and Educational Foundation retired successfully, and the stick to
          promote chess was handed over to the "Pearson Cultural and Educational
          Foundation". meeting". In order to meet the needs of Go work, the
          staff of the original Haifeng Cultural and Educational Foundation have
          also been adjusted and reorganized as "Haifeng Chess Institute" to
          continue to promote Go on the front line.
