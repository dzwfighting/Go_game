        <h3>Go Overview</h3>
        <p>
          According to legend, Go was invented by Emperor Yao around 2300 BC.
          His son Danzhu was proud and self-satisfied, irritable and willful, so
          Emperor Yao invented Go to cultivate his son's character.
        </p>
        <p>
          Go has two kinds of pieces, black and white. It is stipulated that the
          player holding the black piece goes first, and the two players
          alternately place black and white pieces at the intersection points on
          the chessboard grid of nineteen by nineteen lines. After the move is
          over, you can't regret the move. In the process of playing chess,
          encircle the land to capture the stones, and the size of the encircled
          "land" determines the outcome.
        </p>
        <p>
          The rules of Go are simple and elegant, but the gameplay is
          ever-changing. It takes a lot of practice and study to master its
          connotations. Chess master Emmanuel Lasker praised: "If there are
          other intelligent life forms in the universe, they will almost
          certainly know Go." At the same time, Go is considered to be one of
          the most complicated board games in the world. The complexity was
          proved to be PSPACE-hard by Robertson and Munro in 1978.
        </p>
        <p>
          As of mid-2008, there were more than 40 million gamers worldwide, the
          vast majority of them in East Asia. As of the end of 2020, the
          International Go Federation has 77 member countries and 5 association
          members.
        </p>

        <h3>Modern Go:</h3>
        <p>
          After the Meiji Restoration, chess players lost the support of the
          shogunate and began to seek new means of earning a living, which led
          to the emergence of news chess games and the modern rank system, and
          the establishment of a nationwide Japanese chess academy. During the
          Showa era, Wu Qingyuan and Kigu Mino jointly set off the trend of "new
          layout" and started the era of modern Go. Afterwards, first-class
          chess players in the Japanese chess world emerged in large numbers,
          such as Sakata Eiko, Fujisawa Hideyuki, Takakawa Ge, and later Otake
          Hideo, Ishida Yoshio, Takemiya Masaki, Kobayashi Koichi and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1989, Korean Cao Xunxuan won the first Ing's Cup World Go
          Championship, which also triggered an upsurge of Go in Korea. Since
          then, a large number of world chess games have appeared. In these
          chess battles, South Korean Lee Chang-ho stood out from many chess
          players and became the first player in the chess world at that time.
          After 2006, Lee Chang-ho's state declined, and cutting-edge forces
          such as Lee Se-dol and Coulee began to attack him. The next few years
          will be the era of Gu Li and Li Shidol's two heroes fighting for
          hegemony.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the 2010s, many Chinese chess players rose up. Young chess players
          such as Jiang Weijie, Fan Tingyu, Shi Yue, Mi Yuting, Chen Yaoye, Zhou
          Ruiyang, Tan Xiao and so on won the world championships one after
          another.

        <h3>Go culture:</h3>
        <p>
          In the process of spreading Go for thousands of years, many terms have
          gradually been produced. Some of them have already entered the popular
          vocabulary, such as "finale" and so on. Almost every step of Go is
          expressed in related terms, and it is even possible to completely
          describe a local battle in words. For example: Black occupies the star
          position in the upper right corner, Bai Xiaofei hangs, black two
          places high clip, white one jumps, black follows and jumps, white
          Xiaofei enters the corner, black three three blocks... This passage
          uses Go terms to vividly describe common fixed stones journey. Common
          terms are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Called eating: When a chess piece has only one breath, it is called
            hitting and eating. Also known as "calling to eat".
          </li>
          <li>
            Qi: At the empty intersections closely adjacent to the chess pieces
            on the chessboard, the number of Qi of a chess piece cannot exceed
            four Qi, but the connected chess pieces may have more than four Qi.
            It is called "tight air" to place a piece tightly on the way of the
            opponent's piece.
          </li>
          <li>
            Mention: The airless chess pieces will be lifted and taken away from
            the chessboard. Grabbing the opponent's pieces is called "grabbing".
          </li>
          <li>
            Mesh: On the chessboard, the blank intersection surrounded by one
            piece is called "mesh".
          </li>
          <li>
            Land: The sum of the number of meshes surrounded by live chess and
            the live chess itself is called "land".
          </li>
          <li>Empty: The area surrounded by chess pieces.</li>
          <li>
            Jie: The situation where both sides can take turns to extract the
            opponent's pieces. The rules of Go stipulate that when robbing, the
            player who is extracted cannot bring it back directly, and must find
            robbing materials in other places so that the opponent can make a
            move before taking it back.
          </li>
